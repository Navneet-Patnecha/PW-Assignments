    "### Q4 Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), the self keyword is used to refer to the instance of a class within the class definition. It is a convention in Python to use the name self as the first parameter of instance methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the reasons why self is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Referencing Instance Attributes:\n",
    "By using self, you can access and modify the instance attributes (variables) of a class within its methods. It allows you to differentiate between the attributes of different instances of the same class. Without self, you wouldn't be able to access instance-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Method Invocation:\n",
    "Using self as the first parameter in instance methods allows you to call other methods within the class. It ensures that the method being called is associated with the specific instance on which the method is invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Differentiating between Class and Instance Variables:\n",
    "self helps to distinguish between class variables and instance variables. Class variables are shared among all instances of a class, while instance variables are specific to each object. By using self, you can access and modify instance variables, whereas without self, you would be referencing or modifying the class variable.\n",
